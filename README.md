_____How to use:
0) Make sure you download all of the files (otherwise it won't work)
1) Open UserFriendly.py
2) wait for it to load through (it has nothing really to load, but I just added timers just to make it look cool lol)
3) Type in the word that you're trying to find a rhyme
4) If no desirable rhyme can be found try looking up the synonyms of that word

Thank you for downloading my spaghetti-coded masterpiece :)

(P.S.: please disregard the file name RhymeAss - as it is supposed to be RhymeAssistant, but I am too lazy to go change the code lol)
